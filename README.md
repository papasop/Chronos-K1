Validated Physics Structure Learning (VPSL)

A framework for discovering, validating, and transferring physics structure
priors.

Chronos-K1 is the first stage of the Chronos VPSL program.

Chronos is the working repository for VPSL: Validated Physics Structure
Learning. It studies whether explicit physical structure can be validated as a
transferable inductive bias under controlled regimes, fair controls, mechanism
checks, and claim boundaries.

This repository is no longer positioned as only a Lorentz / metric-prior
project. The K1 line remains the bounded framework validation stage. The K2
line is the first fully validated physical structure: a symplectic prior on the
FPU-beta regime.

## 1. What Is Chronos?

Chronos is a Validated Physics Structure Learning (VPSL) framework.

It determines:

1. When a physical structure should become a learning constraint.
2. Whether its effect is predictive.
3. Whether its mechanism is genuine.
4. Whether its advantage transfers.

Chronos is organized as milestones, not as a single architecture:

- K1: framework validation and bounded positive result for spectral /
  Lorentz-structured priors.
- K2: first VPSL-certified structure, validating a symplectic prior on FPU-beta.
- K3: future structure discovery program.

The repository remains a reproducible research prototype. It does not claim a
solved Physics AI system, a universal architecture, or a proof that every
physical prior improves every task.

## 2. Evidence Ladder

VPSL treats a positive result as valid only when the regime, controls,
performance, and mechanism all survive the relevant gates.

| Stage | Result | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | VPSL Framework Validation | Done |
| K1 | Spectral Prior | BOUNDED_POSITIVE |
| K2 | Symplectic Prior | FULL_TRANSFER_CONFIRMED |
| K3 | Future Structures | Pending |

K1 established a bounded framework result: metric-sensitive behavior appears
under controlled normalization tests, but it is not promoted to a universal
physics-prior claim.

K2 established the first full VPSL transfer result:

- `symplectic < baseline`
- `symplectic < fair energy`
- `symplectic < fair L2`
- mechanism transfer confirmed by full symplectic Jacobian error reduction
- confirmation holds on the graceful-baseline subset, not only pooled rescue

Validated Physics Structure Priors

(Regime Validation
 + Constraint Validation
 + Structure Priors)

The current VPSL discipline is:

- Regime validation is a necessary gate before comparing priors.
- Controls must be non-degenerate and fair at the tested horizon.
- Pooled improvements at stress horizons are context only.
- Transfer claims must hold on the graceful-baseline subset.
- Mechanism transfer is required for structure claims.

- `chronos/vpsl/claim_taxonomy.md`
- `chronos/vpsl/numbering.md`

## 4. K1 Archive: Bounded Framework Result

K1 is now treated as the historical framework-validation archive. It studied
whether causal / metric structure can be injected as an explicit inductive bias
in world-model dynamics.

Historical K1 ingredients:

- Lorentz-sign quadratic structure for time / causality.
- Symplectic-dissipative update family.
- Exp6 / Exp7 tests for physics sensitivity and metric specificity.

The strongest K1 evidence remains bounded:

| Experiment | Question | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exp6 | Does Chronos react differently to timelike vs spacelike data? | Positive sensitivity |
| Exp7 | Is the effect specific to Lorentz normalization? | Lorentz-only interaction, Wilcoxon `p=0.040` |

- `k1-manifold-core/docs/experiment_7_metric_controlled_normalization.md`

## 5. K2 Archive: Symplectic Prior

K2 moves beyond Lorentz / metric sensitivity and tests a concrete physical
structure: symplecticity on FPU-beta.

K2.2-A is the current headline result. It tests transfer at `H=200`, where the
baseline has non-trivial hard divergence. The claim is stratified:

- pooled: reported for context only
- graceful-baseline subset: primary transfer test
- rescued subset: blow-up rescue context

K2.2-A verdict:

```text
FULL_TRANSFER_CONFIRMED
```

The K2 claim is intentionally narrow: a symplectic prior transfers on the
validated FPU-beta regime under the tested controls. It is not yet a claim about
all Hamiltonian systems, all horizons, or all model classes.

The repository name on GitHub may still be `Chronos-K1`; the scientific
positioning is now Chronos / VPSL, with K1 as the historical first milestone.

## 7. Claim Boundary

Supported:

- VPSL framework.
- Regime validation methodology.
- K1 bounded positive result.
- First fully validated physical structure: symplectic prior on FPU-beta.

Not claimed:

- All physical priors help.
- All systems benefit from symplectic priors.
- General Physics-AI.
- Chronos is a single architecture.
- K2 generalizes beyond FPU-beta yet.
- Pooled rescue at a stress horizon is enough for a structure claim.

## 9. Roadmap

Current repository program:

- K1 Archive: preserve the original framework-proven line and keep it
  reproducible.
- K2 Archive: preserve the first fully validated VPSL structure claim and its
  transfer-test discipline.
- K3 Structure Discovery Program: evaluate the next physical structures only after
  regime gates, fair controls, mechanism checks, and transfer gates are defined.
